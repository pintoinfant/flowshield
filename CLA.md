**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

### 4. Your Representations and Warranties

You represent that:

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.

2. Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 6 for submissions on behalf of others).

3. Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

4. If You are making the Contribution as an employee, You represent that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, or that You have received permission from Your employer to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer.

### 5. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

**YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.**

### 6. Working on Behalf of Others

If You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to the Project separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as:

```
Submitted on behalf of [name of third party]
Source: [origin of the work]
License: [applicable license]
```

### 7. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

### 8. Scope of License

The licenses granted in this Agreement apply only to Contributions submitted by You. They do not extend to any other work in the Project or to any work You may create independently.

### 9. Future Changes

The Project may adopt a different license in the future, but such adoption will not affect the validity of the licenses granted under this Agreement for Contributions made prior to such change.

1. Agree to the terms of this Contributor License Agreement
2. Certify that You have the legal right to agree to these terms
